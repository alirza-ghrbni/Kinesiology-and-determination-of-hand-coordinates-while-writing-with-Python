# Kinesiology-and-determination-of-hand-coordinates-while-writing-with-Python

This Python script utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect and track hands in real-time through a webcam feed. The script captures frames from the webcam, processes them to detect hand landmarks, and visualizes the detected landmarks and connections on the frames. Additionally, it calculates and displays the frames per second (FPS) achieved during the processing. This code serves as a basic implementation of hand tracking using MediaPipe's hand tracking solution.👨‍💻✅
